    ''' <summary>
    ''' To assist is providing a PCI compliant solution, PayPal now allows a you to upload your
    ''' existing credit card data using a new transaction type.  As the data is uploaded, a 
    ''' transaction id (PNREF) will be generated that can be stored locally to perform a Reference 
    ''' Transaction (tokenization).  This allows you to remove all credit card data from your 
    ''' local servers.  For more information regarding Reference Transactions review the section in 
    ''' the Payflow Developer's Guide.
    ''' 
    ''' The transaction type value is "L" which allows the credit card data to be sent and stored 
    ''' without being sent to the banks for processing.  You must send at miminum the following 
    ''' items: TRXTYPE, TENDER, ACCT and EXPDATE.
    ''' 
    '''  As you can see, you can send in Billing and Shipping information to be stored, but you must 
    '''  not include the AMT field.  If AMT is passed you will receive a RESULT=4, RESPMSG=Invalid Amount error.  
    ''' 
    ''' IMPORTANT:  The credit card data sent for storage is not verified in any way as it is not 
    ''' sent to the banks for processing.  To validate a transaction, you would do an account 
    ''' verification; also known as a, zero dollar authorization, type transaction. 
    ''' 
    ''' NOTE:  This is processor dependent and not all processors support this feature.
    ''' 
    ''' For Reference transactions, please use ReferenceTransaction class and for Recurring use 
    ''' RecurringTransaction base class.
