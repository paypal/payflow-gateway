    ''' <summary> 
    ''' This class uses the Payflow SDK Data Objects to do a normal SET Express Checkout transaction. 
    ''' The request is sent as a Data Object and the response received is also a Data Object. 
    ''' 
    ''' Express Checkout offers your customers an easy, convenient checkout experience. It lets them 
    ''' use shipping and billing information stored securely at PayPal to check out, so they don’t have 
    ''' to re-enter it on your site. 
    ''' 
    ''' From the perspective of website development, Express Checkout works like other Payflow Pro 
    ''' features. You submit transaction information to the server as name-value pair parameter 
    ''' strings or using Data Objects as this example. 
    ''' 
    ''' Refer to the "PayPal Express Checkout Transaction Processing" chapter of the Payflow Pro Developer's 
    ''' Guide (US, AU) or the Websites Payments Pro Payflow Edition Developer's Guide (UK). 
    ''' 
    ''' This sample is for reference and for testing purposes only. See the eStoreFront sample for 
    ''' one way to perform an Express Checkout transaction from your web site. The eStoreFront sample does 
    ''' not include reference transactions.
    ''' 
    ''' Besides doing a standard Express Checkout transactions, you can also do a Express Checkout Reference
    ''' Transaction.
    ''' 
    ''' A reference transaction takes existing billing information already gathered from a previously 
    ''' authorized transaction and reuses it to charge the customer in a subsequent transaction. 
    ''' Reference transactions, typically used for repeat billing to a merchants PayPal account when 
    ''' customers are not present to log in, are now supported through Express Checkout. 
    ''' 
    ''' NOTE: You must be enabled by PayPal to use reference transactions. Contact your account manager 
    ''' or the sales department for more details. 
    ''' 
    ''' To implement a reference transaction, you must first obtain a billing agreement from the 
    ''' customer. The customer logs into PayPal once to consent to the billing agreement, after which 
    ''' customer login is not required. The customer’s consent allows PayPal to withdraw funds from 
    ''' the customer’s PayPal account. 
    ''' 
    ''' The billing agreement is good until canceled by you or the customer. A customer may have 
    ''' more than one billing agreement for your website. This can occur if the customer establishes 
    ''' separate agreements for different kinds of service. If you use reference transactions, be sure 
    ''' that they are associated with the correct billing agreement. 
    ''' 
    ''' When you implement reference transactions on your website, the customer can choose to 
    ''' accept or reject the billing agreement with or without making a purchase.

            ' The PayPal Pay Later service allows online merchants to offer promotional financing to
            ' buyers at checkout - even if a buyer doesn't have a PayPal account. Promotional offers, such as

            ' shoppers.
            ' The PayPal Pay Later service is issued by GE Money Bank, one of the world's leading
            ' providers of consumer credit.

            ' Say that you have implemented Express Checkout on your website. The customer logs in to 
            ' purchase an item of merchandise and chooses PayPal to pay for it. In the normal Express 
            ' Checkout flow, the customer is then redirected to PayPal to log in to verify their billing 
            ' information. If the customer approves payment on the Confirmation page when you are using 
            ' a reference transaction, you receive the billing agreement as part of the transaction.You can

            ' once-a-month, for future purchases. The customer doesn’t need to log into PayPal each time to 
            ' make a payment.

            ' customer logs in to your website to order a magazine subscription, you set up an agreement to

            ' without purchase, the customer is redirected to PayPal to log in. On the PayPal site, they 
            ' consent to the billing agreement. Next month, when you send the customer the first magazine 
            ' issue, the billing agreement authorizes you to start charging the customer’s PayPal account on 
            ' the agreed upon recurring basis without having the customer log in to PayPal.
