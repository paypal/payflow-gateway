    ''' <summary> 
    ''' This class uses the Payflow SDK Data Objects to do a normal DO Express Checkout transaction. 
    ''' The request is sent as a Data Object and the response received is also a Data Object. 
    ''' 
    ''' This sample is for reference and for testing purposes only. See the eStoreFront sample for 
    ''' one way to perform an Express Checkout transaction from your web site. 
    ''' 
    ''' Refer to the "PayPal Express Checkout Transaction Processing" chapter of the Payflow Pro Developer's 
    ''' Guide (US, AU) or the Websites Payments Pro Payflow Edition Developer's Guide (UK). 
    ''' 
    ''' Besides doing a standard Express Checkout transactions, you can also do a Express Checkout Reference
    ''' Transaction.
    ''' 
    ''' A reference transaction takes existing billing information already gathered from a previously 
    ''' authorized transaction and reuses it to charge the customer in a subsequent transaction. 
    ''' Reference transactions, typically used for repeat billing to a merchants PayPal account when 
    ''' customers are not present to log in, are now supported through Express Checkout. 
    ''' 
    ''' NOTE: You must be enabled by PayPal to use reference transactions. Contact your account manager 
    ''' or the sales department for more details. 
    ''' 
    ''' See the DOSetEC Sample for more details on Reference Transations using Express Checkout.
