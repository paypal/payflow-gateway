    ''' <summary>
    ''' This class uses the Payflow SDK Data Objects to do a simple Partial Authorize transaction.
    ''' The request is sent as a Data Object and the response received is also a Data Object.
    '''
    ''' Partial Approval is supported for Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover (JCB (US Domestic only), 
    ''' and Diners) Prepaid card products such as gift, Flexible Spending Account (FSA) or Healthcare Reimbursement 
    ''' Account (HRA) cards. In addition Discover (JCB (US Domestic only), and Diners) supports partial Approval on 
    ''' their consumer credit card. It is often difficult for the consumer to spend the exact amount available on 
    ''' the prepaid account, as the purchase can be for amounts greater than the value available. This can result 
    ''' in unnecessary declines. Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover (JCB (US Domestic only), and 
    ''' Diners) recognize that the prepaid products represent unique opportunities for both merchants and consumers. 
    ''' With Partial Approval issuers may approve a portion of the amount requested. This will enable the residual 
    ''' transaction amount to be paid by other means. The introduction of the partial approval capability will 
    ''' reduce decline frequency and enhance the consumer and merchant experience at the point of sale. Merchants 
    ''' will now have the ability to accept partial approval rather than having the sale declined.
