    ''' <summary>
    ''' This class uses the Payflow SDK Recurring Transaction object to do a simple Recurring Add transaction.
    ''' The request is sent as a Data Object and the response received is also a Data Object.
    ''' The Recurring Transaction object should be used be used only in a remote scenario when the user
    ''' needs to do a recurring transaction type which is not directly supported by the transaction objects 
    ''' provided by the SDK. Doing a transaction in this fashion enables the user to have flexibility in 
    ''' terms of specifying the transaction type (TRXTYPE).
    ''' For normal transactions, please use BaseTransaction class and for Recurring use RecurringTransaction 
    ''' base class.
