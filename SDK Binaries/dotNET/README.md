This .NET SDK package for Payflow v4.46 is a direct replacement for the current .dll in use.  There are no API changes to this
SDK outside of TLS 1.2 support.  However, if using COM (Classic ASP) you'll need to un-register old .DLL and re-register the new one.

v4.46
Fully backwards compatible with previous versions.

Added new Request NVPs - AUTHTYPE (Telecheck) and FREQUENCY (Recurring Billing)
Added new Response NVPs - TRACEID and ACHSTATUS (both TeleCheck)

You must be using .NET 4.5 or greater for TLS 1.2 support. However, if still using .NET 3.5 (2.0) see this artricle https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/3154519/support-for-tls-system-default-versions-included-in-the-net-framework
