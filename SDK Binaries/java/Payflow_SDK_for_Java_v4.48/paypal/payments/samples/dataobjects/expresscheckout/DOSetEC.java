// This class uses the Payflow SDK Data Objects to do a normal SET Express Checkout transaction.
// The request is sent as a Data Object and the response received is also a Data Object.
//
// Express Checkout offers your customers an easy, convenient checkout experience. It lets them
// use shipping and billing information stored securely at PayPal to check out, so they don�t have
// to re-enter it on your site.
//
// From the perspective of website development, Express Checkout works like other Payflow Pro
// features. You submit transaction information to the server as name-value pair parameter
// strings.
//
// Refer to the "PayPal Express Checkout Transaction Processing" chapter of the Payflow Pro Developers
// Guide (US, AU) or the Websites Payments Pro Payflow Edition Developers Guide (UK).
//
// This sample is for reference and for testing purposes only.  See the eStoreFront sample for
// one way to perform an Express Checkout transaction from your web site.
//
// Besides doing a standard Express Checkout transactions, you can also do a Express Checkout Reference
// Transaction.
//
// A reference transaction takes existing billing information already gathered from a previously
// authorized transaction and reuses it to charge the customer in a subsequent transaction.
// Reference transactions, typically used for repeat billing to a merchants PayPal account when
// customers are not present to log in, are now supported through Express Checkout.
//
// NOTE: You must be enabled by PayPal to use reference transactions.  Contact your account manager
// or the sales department for more details.
//
// To implement a reference transaction, you must first obtain a billing agreement from the
// customer. The customer logs into PayPal once to consent to the billing agreement, after which
// customer login is not required. The customer�s consent allows PayPal to withdraw funds from
// the customer�s PayPal account.
//
// The billing agreement is good until canceled by you or the customer. A customer may have
// more than one billing agreement for your website. This can occur if the customer establishes
// separate agreements for different kinds of service. If you use reference transactions, be sure
// that they are associated with the correct billing agreement.
//
// When you implement reference transactions on your website, the customer can choose to
// accept or reject the billing agreement with or without making a purchase.

        // once your account is active with the feature.

        // *** With Making a Purchase ***
        // Say that you have implemented Express Checkout on your website. The customer logs in to
        // purchase an item of merchandise and chooses PayPal to pay for it. In the normal Express
        // Checkout flow, the customer is then redirected to PayPal to log in to verify their billing
        // information. If the customer approves payment on the Confirmation page when you are using
        // a reference transaction, you receive the billing agreement as part of the transaction.You can
        // use that billing agreement later to bill the customer a set amount on a recurring basis, such as
        // once-a-month, for future purchases. The customer doesn�t need to log into PayPal each time to
        // make a payment.
        //
        // Create the data object for Express Checkout Reference Transaction SET operation
        // with Purchase using ECSetRequest Data Object.
        //ECSetRequest setRequest = new ECSetRequest("http://www.myreturnurl.com", "http://www.mycancelurl.com",
        //		"MerchantInitiatedBilling", "Test Description", "any", "BACustom");

        // *** Without Making a Purchase ***
        // Typically, the customer chooses a billing agreement without making a purchase when they
        // subscribe for merchandise they will pay for on a recurring schedule. If, for example, the
        // customer logs in to your website to order a magazine subscription, you set up an agreement to
        // bill the customer on a scheduled basis, say, once a month. In the billing agreement flow
        // without purchase, the customer is redirected to PayPal to log in. On the PayPal site, they
        // consent to the billing agreement. Next month, when you send the customer the first magazine
        // issue, the billing agreement authorizes you to start charging the customer�s PayPal account on
        // the agreed upon recurring basis without having the customer log in to PayPal.

        // Create the data object for Express Checkout Reference Transaction SET operation
