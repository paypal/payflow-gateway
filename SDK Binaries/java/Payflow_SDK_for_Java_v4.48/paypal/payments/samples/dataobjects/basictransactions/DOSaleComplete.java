        /*
        This sample does not include all the available parameters available; however, it gives you a general
        idea of the most common ones.
         */

        /* NOTE: All information regarding the available objects within payflow_jar can be found in the API doc
           found under the "Docs" directory of the installed SDK.  You will also need to refer to the Website
           Payments Pro Payflow Edition or Payflow Pro Developerï¿½s Guide found in the downloads section of PayPal
           Manager at https://manager.paypal.com.

           Request ID: the request Id is a unique id that you send with your transaction data.  This Id if not changed
           will help prevent duplicate transactions.  The idea is to set this Id outside the loop or if on a page,
           prior to the final confirmation page.

           Once the transaction is sent and if you don't receive a response you can resend the transaction and the
           server will respond with the response data of the original submission.  Also, the object,
           Trans.Response.TransactionResponse.Duplicate will be set to "1" if the transaction is a duplicate.

           This allows you to resend transaction requests should there be a network or user issue without re-charging
           a customers credit card.

           COMMON ISSUES:

		   Result Code 1:
		    Is usually caused by one of the following:
			** Invalid login information, see result code 26 below.
			** IP Restrictions on the account. Verify there are no ip restrictions in Manager under Service Settings.

		   Result Code 26:
			Verify USER, VENDOR, PARTNER and PASSWORD. Remember, USER and VENDOR are both the merchant login
			ID unless a Payflow Pro USER was created.  All fields are case-sensitive. See this post for more
			information: http://www.x.com/docs/DOC-1884.

			Receiving Communication Exceptions or No Response:
			Since this service is based on HTTPS it is possible that due to network issues either on PayPals side or
			yours that you can not process a transaction.  If this is the case, what is suggested is that you put some
			type of loop in your code to try up to X times before "giving up".  This example will try to get a response
			up to 3 times before it fails and by using the Request ID as described above, you can do these attempts without
			the chance of causing duplicate charges on your customers credit card.
